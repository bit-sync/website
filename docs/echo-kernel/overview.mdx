# Echo Kernel Overview

The Echo Kernel is a minimalist, educational operating system kernel designed to demonstrate core OS concepts. The kernel focuses on simplicity and readability while providing essential functionality.

## Core Features

- **Minimalist Design**: Streamlined architecture focusing on essential kernel operations
- **Basic Shell Interface**: Simple command-line interface (Eshell) for user interaction
- **Hardware I/O**: Direct hardware interaction through port I/O operations
- **Memory Management**: Basic memory operations and management
- **Display and Keyboard Support**: Fundamental I/O device drivers

## Architecture

The Echo Kernel is built with a minimalist architecture that prioritizes simplicity and educational value. The system is organized into several key components:

### Core Components

- **Kernel Core**: Main kernel loop and system initialization
- **Shell (Eshell)**: Command-line interface for user interaction
- **Hardware I/O**: Port-based hardware communication
- **Memory Management**: Basic memory operations
- **Device Drivers**: Display and keyboard support

### System Organization

├── kernel/         # Core kernel code
├── sys/           # System components
└── lib/           # Utility functions
```

## Hardware Interaction

The kernel interacts with hardware through port I/O operations, providing:

- ACPI power management
- Keyboard controller interface
- Display output
- Basic hardware status checks

## Shell Interface

Eshell provides a simple command-line interface with basic commands:

- `clear`: Clear the screen
- `help`: Display available commands
- `shutdown`: Safely power off the system

## Memory Management

Basic memory management providing:

- Memory allocation
- Memory operations (copy, set, etc.)
- Simple memory safety checks

## Building and Running

The kernel can be built using the provided Makefile:

```bash
make build
```

Run the kernel using QEMU:

```bash
make run
```

## Recent Changes

The kernel has been significantly simplified in version 0.2.0:

- Removed complex process management
- Streamlined core functionality
- Enhanced shutdown mechanism with multiple methods
- Improved hardware interaction through port I/O

## Future Development

Planned improvements include:

- Enhanced error handling
- Additional shell commands
- Improved system initialization
- Better debugging capabilities

## System Requirements

- x86 compatible processor
- At least 32MB RAM
- VGA-compatible display
- PS/2 keyboard
- ACPI or APM support (for shutdown functionality)
